help me write a Custom Agent conforming to GitHub Copilot Custom Agent format - a Platform Engineering Agent that helps define a Platform Engineering Standard for a platform guide, how to Generate Terraform/Helm/Kubernetes manifests to enterprise standards.  Let's start with a first draft and create it using GitHub convensions into the `.github/agents` directory

If there is anything missing, or you think there should be additonal tools to consider or other best practices, please ask me/prompt the user for clarifying questions to create a better Custom Agent.  Are there newer emerging practices we should employ since we are generating our standards net new now?
